    "description": "Destiny is an online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and previously published by Activision. Destiny is now self-published by Bungie after separating from Activision in 2019.[3] It was released worldwide on September 9, 2014, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles. Destiny marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the Halo series, and it was the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision. Set in a \"mythic science fiction\" world, the game features a multiplayer \"shared-world\" environment with elements of role-playing games. Activities in Destiny are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \"strikes\" and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.\n\nPlayers take on the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the City from different alien races. Guardians are tasked with reviving a celestial being called the Traveler, while journeying to different planets to investigate and destroy the alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out. Bungie released four expansion packs, furthering the story, and adding new content, missions, and new PvP modes. Year One of Destiny featured two small expansions, The Dark Below in December 2014 and House of Wolves in May 2015. A third, larger expansion, The Taken King, was released in September 2015 and marked the beginning of Year Two, changing much of the core gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into Destiny: The Taken King Legendary Edition. Another large expansion called Rise of Iron was released in September 2016, beginning Year Three. Rise of Iron was only released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One; PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 clients subsequently stopped receiving content updates. The base game and all four expansions were packaged into Destiny: The Collection. A sequel, Destiny 2, released in September 2017.\n\nUpon its release, Destiny received generally positive reviews, with praise for its gameplay, graphics, and for maintaining lineage from the Halo franchise, particularly in regards to its competitive experiences. Criticism centered mostly around the game's storyline and post-campaign content. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. It sold over US$325 million at retail in its first five days, making it the biggest new franchise launch of all time. It was GamesRadar's 2014 Game of the Year and it received the BAFTA Award for Best Game at the 2014 British Academy Video Games Awards.",

        "name": "The Spire",
        "description": "There are three Sync Plates that must be activated and protected simultaneously. The best way to do this is to split the fireteam into three groups of two members each and have each group activate and protect one plate. The plates can be activated by standing in the circle for a few seconds. Once the plate is activated, the Guardians do not need to remain inside it, but must defend it from Vex (only Praetorians can take control of Sync Plates, but other Vex will spawn as well). Each zone has line-of-sight of each other, so it is possible to provide support for the other groups if they are having a tough time. For example, if you see your team mates struggling on one of the zones that is visible to you, then you can snipe or shoot rockets to help clear out the Vex.The plate at the top near the entrance is typically the easiest to defend, so the two group members who are defending the top Sync Plate should help the others when possible. However, one member should always stay at the top. Praetorians, (upgraded Minotaurs), will spawn with Void shields here and attempt to retake the sync plates; they must be prevented from entering the circles. They will be accompanied by other Vex units, but only the Praetorians pose a threat to the plates.\n\nWhile all 3 plates are held by the guardians, a spire will slowly form on a platform opposite the vault door. If a sync plate is taken by a Praetorian it will reverse its growth and deteriorate until the plate is returned to Guardian control. You can tell if the sync plate is taken by a Praetorian if the sync plate fades from the white glow to a red glowing sync plate; at this point you need to clear out the Praetorian and regain control of the sync plate. The Guardians must control all the plates for two minutes for the spire to fully form.\n\nAfter the Spire has formed, a beam of light will shoot from it, opening the Vault of Glass. The fireteam can then enter.",

        "description": "After the first chest and some light platform jumping, the fireteam will come to a ledge. Dropping down from it will spawn The Templar. At this point, he cannot be damaged. There will be a Conflux where the team lands that the group must defend from waves of Vex. It looks similar to the spire that was built in the first part of the raid. If four Vex sacrifice themselves to the Conflux, the fireteam will all be killed (\"wiped\").\n\nIn addition to the normal Vex, special enemies called Fanatics will appear, distinguishable by their green aura. When a Fanatic is killed, a green puddle will appear on the ground that must be avoided until it dissipates. Walking into the puddle will mark the Guardian with a debuff called the Mark of Negation. The Templar will occasionally use an attack called \"Ritual of Negation\" that will kill all marked Guardians. In order to get rid of the mark, affected Guardians must cleanse themselves by walking into the fountain of light in the middle of the stage.\n\nAfter the conflux has been defended for a while, it will disappear. The Templar will then summon its legions, announced with an onscreen message to that effect. This will spawn a large number of Fanatics and a few major Hydra Vex. You can avoid fighting them by getting to higher ground. Once all of these enemies have been killed, or a once certain amount of time has passed, two new confluxes will appear, one on each side of the area. Once again, they must be defended against approaching Vex, and four sacrifices on either conflux (counted separately) must be prevented.\n\nOnce the two confluxes have been defended, the Templar will summon its legions again, and then the whole cycle repeats itself a third time with three confluxes in play. After defeating the third legion, the fireteam proceeds to the next phase.",

Oracles make a distinctive chime sound when they spawn; each location can be identified by their specific pitch, which is previewed at the start of the phase.\n\nThey will be supported by other Vex units and Hobgoblins that spawn on the platforms that surround the area. Once the Oracles spawn, the players must quickly kill them within 15 seconds. If any Oracles survive for too long, all living players will receive the Mark of Negation and must cleanse themselves or be killed by the Templar's ritual. When seven waves (each of which spawns increasingly more Oracles) are dispatched, the next phase will start.",

        "description": "A relic will spawn in the middle of the room. One Guardian can pick up the relic, which will give that Guardian a shield weapon while it is held. While holding the relic, the player will only have access to melee attacks. The relic-holder will have three types of melee attacks: the melee button will perform a quick dash that deals minimal damage in exchange for high speed, the fire button will perform a stronger dash attack with a longer range that deals massive single-target damage and is capable of killing all enemies barring Praetorians instantly, and pressing the fire button in midair will perform an AOE ground slam attack that deals massive damage to nearby enemies. Note that the quick-dash can also be used as a sort of glide that allows the relic user to quickly escape from sticky situations, or to cross large distances quickly.\n\nWhen the relic is picked up, The Templar will spawn. He has a shield that is immune to all conventional attacks. To remove the shield, the relic's super attack must be used, which fires a projectile much like a rocket launcher. When his shield is taken down, some Guardians will randomly be surrounded by a red globe (\"detained\"), which hinders movement and blocks shots. The detainment field must be destroyed to free the Guardian. If the Guardian leaves the globe without destroying it, they will be killed in a matter of seconds. It is therefore not recommended to be moving or in the air when the globes spawn as the Guardian will fall out.\n\nAfter its shield is removed, the Templar will attempt to teleport; if he succeeds he will regain his shield. The location that he teleports to will be marked with a ring. If a Guardian stands in this ring for a few seconds, the teleport is canceled, extending the time that The Templar is vulnerable but spawning a Minotaur.\n\nOracles will also spawn during the fight. Failing to kill them in time results in them marking the Guardians. Note that during this phase, the fountain of light will not be present. In order to cleanse, the relic-holder is given a special shield similar to Ward of Dawn that replaces their grenade. This shield barrier cleanses all Guardians inside it and blocks all incoming attacks, although Guardians inside the shield can still shoot out through it. It is best to gather around the relic-holder when Guardians are marked to make sure everyone in the team is cleansed together. When the barrier is used, a cooldown will occur, preventing the user from activating it again for a short time. The duration of this cooldown depends on how long the barrier was previously used for.\n\nIf the Templar is fired at with the relic and the detain bubbles spawn before the Templar completes his ritual, then the ritual can be interrupted, allowing players with additional time to obtain a cleanse of the Mark of Negation debuff if need be.\n\nIf the Templar is not killed within eight minutes, he will become Enraged. While Enraged, the spawn rate of all enemies is increased, and Minotaurs spawn constantly. The Templar will also use the Ritual of Negation more frequently.\n\nOnce the Templar is killed, the team will automatically receive rewards. Additionally, there is a chest containing Spirit Bloom in a small hole in the wall on the left side of the room about 10 feet up, by where the left Conflux spawns. There is also a tunnel in the room that, if taken, provides an alternate route to the left chest in the Gorgon's Labyrinth. This route also leads to a \"mysterious\" chest platform that is only accessible through this tunnel. This chest will only be available to the raid group if the Templar was unable to teleport during the battle.",

If any member of the team is seen, all members will be killed after 10 seconds and must start the maze over from the beginning. It is possible to kill Gorgons despite their immense amount of health, but if a Gorgon is killed all others will gain an immunity timer (they will not take damage for a period of time) if they spot a player and the timer will grow (up until it reaches a maximum of about 3 or 4 seconds) if additional Gorgons are killed.\n\nThere are two Chests in this maze: the first is to the left after you get to the bottom at the start of the maze. You will have to scale a short portion of the wall and go through a short tunnel. If you took the tunnel leading from the Templar area, then you will not have to scale the wall and will be near the chest before dropping to the floor of the Labyrinth.

        "description": "The final area is a room that houses a Gatekeeper and a swarm of Hobgoblins and Goblins. Clear the room of all enemies. There are two portals, called Vex Timegates, with corresponding Sync Plates that function identically to the ones at the beginning of the raid. After killing the Gatekeeper, a Relic spawns, and the Sync Plates activate and may now be used to open the portals by having a Guardian stand in them for a few seconds.\n\nA group of Guardians should enter one of the portals while the remaining members stay outside. The group that stays back needs to defend the sync plate from the Vex. If a Praetorian regains control of the plate and closes the portal, an Oracle will spawn above the now closed portal. If the Oracle is not destroyed, the Guardians protecting the plate will die. This leaves the group inside the portal \"forever lost in the dark corners of time,\" killing them. The group that enters the portal needs to kill a Gatekeeper and retrieve a relic that spawns upon its death. Once the Gatekeeper is killed, the portal members will be given a debuff called \"Marked by the Void\" that remains as long as they are in the portal. This debuff will gradually cloud a player's vision until the screen is completely black, but can be removed by the cleanse function of the relic (it should be noted that the debuff can also do damage to players if they manage to stay alive with the debuff for an extended period of time). Once the relic is retrieved, the group must exit the portal.\n\nAfter you kill the first Gatekeeper, a Conflux will spawn in the center of the area that must also be defended. Minotaurs will constantly spawn and attempt to sacrifice themselves, so assign someone to defend the Conflux while the others proceed to the second portal. If four sacrifices occur at the conflux then the entire team will be killed.\n\nThe Guardian with the relic should accompany at least one other player into the second portal, leaving the rest of the team to defend both the corresponding sync plate and the Conflux. The player with the relic should keep the portal team's vision clear, as all members in the portal will constantly be debuffed by Mark of the Void. The rest of the group must kill a Gatekeeper and his minions, and retrieve a second relic; the use of the first relic will make this task much easier. Once the second relic is retrieved, the group must exit the portal, cleansing all marked members upon returning.\n\nAn alternative, more advanced strategy is to send a team of two Guardians in to each portal at the same time, coordinating Gatekeeper kills, since its death triggers the Conflux. Then, both teams must exit the portals as quickly as possible, and both relic holders defend the Conflux after cleansing the team. Occasionally, something will cause a party wipe after utilizing this strategy. If the loot has already been given, the game will recognize the checkpoint, and continue on to fighting Atheon after the team respawns.\n\nWhen back in the room, you must kill the rest of the minions that spawn in order to clear phase 1. Once this is achieved, both relics and the conflux will disappear, and loot will be given.",

        "description": "Shortly (about 20 seconds) after appearing, Atheon will \"open the timestream,\" teleporting three random Guardians into one of the portal regions. The Guardians inside the portal will appear next to a relic, which one Guardian must take. Mark of the Void will again continuously inflict its debuff on all portal members. Six Oracles will spawn, one at a time and in a fixed location, and must be killed. When all Oracles and enemies in the portal are killed, the entire fireteam will receive a buff called \"Time's Vengeance\" for 30 seconds. This buff will dramatically increase all damage dealt to Atheon, charge all supers and grenades in two seconds, and allow the cleansing shield be used for its entire duration.The Guardians outside the portal are required to activate the timegate the others have been teleported into in order for them to escape; the portal team must communicate which portal they have been sent to upon arrival. During each teleport phase, Harpy variants called Supplicants will spawn three at a time alternating between the right and left. Supplicants are extremely agile and will explode when they are in close proximity to a Guardian, usually resulting in the player's death.\n\nDuring \"Time's Vengeance,\" once all Guardians return from the portal, all damage should be concentrated on Atheon. The relic's super attack is very strong against Atheon and the shield function can be used constantly for the duration of the buff, allowing the team a safe refuge from which to fire on him. It is recommended that the team go to the small floating platform between the time portals as they will be out of the reach of Supplicants there. When Time's Vengeance runs out, the process repeats, and continues until Atheon is defeated. If players wish to use rockets, they must exit the bubble. Otherwise, the rocket will hit the bubble and detonate, resulting in the death of the user.\n\nOn the Normal difficulty, seven minutes after Atheon spawns an alert will appear that enrage is near, and after eight minutes he will become enraged. While enraged, Atheon attacks more frequently and spawns significantly more Supplicants.",

        "description": "The team will land in a lighted area at the bottom of the Hellmouth. A pillar of white light can be seen in the distance. This area, outside the starting point, will continuously apply a debuff called Weight of Darkness, which can stack up to 10 times. It disables the ability to double-jump and reduces movement speed. Weight of Darkness can only be removed by standing close to one of the lighted pillars. However, as each pillar is used, the light will eventually turn orange/red, indicating that it has absorbed as much darkness as it can. Once the light is a deep red it will explode, killing anyone caught in the blast. The team must travel from light to light, fighting off hordes of Thrall and the occasional Cursed Thrall and Knight until reaching the end of the area. This only requires 1 guardian to complete so if preferred the team may choose 1 player to complete this alone and the others can fight off the Thrall.\n\nAfter reaching the last pillar there is another plate on the ground, similar to the one which triggered the bridge at the beginning of the raid. Once a guardian enters this circle, an enormous door opens to reveal a blinding white light, and a bridge gradually forms leading into it.\n\nWhile the bridge is forming, three Knights and an Ogre will spawn. Once the bridge is formed, up to three additional Ogres and three additional Knights will spawn. They will continue to respawn until the players reach the end. An Ogre will occasionally spawn at the end of the bridge. At least one player must run into the light and reach the end, which will advance the team to the next raid phase and drop loot.",

        "description": "This area is divided into two separate platforms, connected by a temporary bridge which again must be formed by a guardian standing in a circle. Unlike previous bridge-forming circles, the guardian must remain in the circle to keep the bridge present, it will decay and disappear if the circle is not occupied. To both the left and right of the forming circle are floating pillars called Annihilation Totems. While the bridge is being formed, the totems will start turning orange and will wipe the team after a few seconds. This must be countered by having two additional players (one on each side) stand in the circles beneath the totems. The players can also abandon the attempt to form the bridge (by stepping out of the circle) to prevent a wipe if the totems have not yet fired.\n\nThe phase is begun when a guardian begins forming the bridge, which will trigger enemy spawns. Among the normal Hive enemies is a Swordbearer. When a Swordbearer is killed, it will drop a sword which one player must pick up within a brief period of time before it despawns. Only players carrying a sword may cross the bridge; swordless players who step onto it will be instantly killed from a debuff called Bane of the Swordless. The sword will last for 1 minute after being picked up, so the other team members must coordinate to have the bridge fully formed at the moment the sword is claimed.\n\nOn the other side of the bridge, the sword carrier will encounter blue knight variants called Gatekeepers. These can only be damaged by the sword, so the carrier must kill them quickly before the sword disappears. One gatekeeper will spawn for each Swordbearer killed. When the Gatekeeper is killed, one of the totems near the door will light up.\n\nThe carrier must also be careful not to spend too much time in the bridge-forming circle on the far side as that will trigger a second set of annihilation totems.\n\nOnce the sword despawns, another Swordbearer will emerge and the process must be repeated to move a second player across the bridge, and then again for a third. At that point the two halves of the team switch roles, and the players on the far side of the bridge must use their own forming circle and anti-totem circles to form the bridge while the players remaining on the starting side obtain swords and come across.\n\nAfter five Gatekeepers have been killed, the bridge will permanently solidify and the sixth player will not be required to obtain a Cleaver to cross it. Six new Cleavers will spawn on the far side of the bridge, accompanied by a large number of Hive and five more Gatekeepers. Once these have been killed and all ten statues powered up, the encounter will be completed.\n\nThe team must now run a gauntlet of Thralls, Cursed Thralls, and Shriekers to descend into the final area.",

Once started, the shielded doorways will come up, sealing the team within the room while Knights and Acolytes spawn outside and surround it. Crota will spawn on the platform across from the crystal chamber. Once Crota has spawned, the shielded doors will drop and the horde will attack.\n\nDuring this entire fight, a debuff will be active called \"Presence of Crota\" which prevents normal health regeneration. Health may be regenerated by claiming the Chalice of Light, an item which spawns in the arena below Crota and may be held by one player at a time. Picking up the Chalice or taking it from another player will immediately trigger regeneration and holding it will allow regeneration to work normally. Any weapon perks, armor perks, or subclass abilities that grant health regeneration will still work.\n\nCrota possesses a shield which can be damaged by normal weapons, but which will recharge almost immediately if not continuously fired upon. Once the shield is down, Crota will kneel for about five seconds. During these five seconds, his health is vulnerable to damage by a Hive Cleaver, which the players must obtain by killing a Swordbearer in the arena below his walkway. The team must precisely match the arrival of the player carrying the sword at Crota with the fall of his shield so that the sword may be used to do as much damage to his health as possible.\n\nWhen Crota gets back up from kneeling, he will be briefly immune to weapons, indicated by an orange glow. He will also \"summon his oversoul\", which causes the gray sphere behind him to expand. The fireteam must fire their weapons at it until it disappears. If this is not done within ten seconds, the entire team will be killed.\n\nAfter two Swordbearers are killed, two Hallowed Ogres will spawn underneath the towers housing the Knights using Boomers. They must be killed before another Swordbearer will spawn.\n\nCrota will enrage if not killed within twelve minutes. While enraged, Crota will use the Oversoul repeatedly, and Ogres will spawn constantly.",

Any player death (even if immediately resurrected) will activate a rune carved into it. If all six runes are activated, the tablet will blind and then kill the entire fireteam.\n\nGolgoroth is a large mutated ogre who fires his beam attack constantly. He possesses two weak spots, one on his chest and one on his back. Above him are six more bubbles of darkness, each of which if shot down will produce a small pool of light on the floor of his arena which greatly increases damage done to him. Golgoroth will kill any Guardian jumping down to take advantage of that unless his Gaze is held by another player. Capturing his gaze is accomplished by shooting him in the back, which will cause him to turn his attention to the shooter and switch from firing his ogre beam to firing seeking projectiles similar to those of a Taken Centurion. The player who has drawn his attention must not seek cover or break Golgoroth's line of sight at this point, but instead stand their ground and shoot down the projectiles, thus holding his gaze. Golgoroth's attention will be focused on that player for a short time, indicated by a timer on the HUD. During that time, the remaining players are free to shoot down a bubble, enter the pit, and shoot Golgoroth's chest without reprisal from him. Once the gaze timer runs down, a second player on the opposite side of the area should capture his gaze, to maintain the safety of the arena attackers; this will cause Golgoroth to turn around so another bubble must be shot down and the attackers relocate to the new pool to continue attacking. This handoff may be done six times, after which there are no more bubbles and the attackers must leave the arena. Cursed thrall will pour into the arena to make damaging Golgoroth during this attack difficult. Alternatively, only one player can be a dedicated gaze holder, with the other five players damaging him in the pit and needing only one bubble per damage cycle, thus avoiding the Cursed Thrall until the Taken phase.\n\nAfter a short time, the bubbles respawn and the cycle may be performed repeatedly until Golgoroth is dead.\n\nWhen Golgoroth has 35 ~ 40% health left, Taken will spawn instead of Hive, making Golgoroth harder to kill.

        "description": "Oryx appears when a player approaches the spark. After the players kill the knights spawned on the front 2 platforms, Oryx will move to front left or right platform. This will create a mote of light on that platform, and four special enemies called Light-Eater Ogres will emerge from the ground, one near each platform\n\nOne player must claim the spark, becoming torn between dimensions. Their role is to navigate the summoned platforms and reach the spark hanging overhead.\n\nAt the same time, 3 other players must summon the platforms the torn player needs. Just as before, the platforms must be triggered in a counter-clockwise sequence starting from the platform on which the mote appeared. Meanwhile the 2 remaing guardians should stay in the middle to kill the Light Eater Ogres. This has to be done as quickly as they spawn to keep the blights that the ogres spawn out of pathing, so that they can be detonated when the time is ready.\n\nWhen the torn player reaches the overhead spark and claims it, a Tombship will fly through the arena and deliver a special Knight named Vessel of Oryx, which will run up the central path. The torn player must jump down to intercept it, and then hold Square, to discharge the spark and steal the knight's aura.\n\nStealing the Knight's aura makes the knight vulnerable to all players, and also offers protection from damage to all players standing near the player who stole the aura. At this point, every player must converge on the Vessel of Oryx and kill it as quickly as possible. It is recommended that this be done near the center of the arena, to avoid the Corrupted Light spheres.\n\nOnce the Vessel of Oryx is killed, Oryx prepares to use his ultimate attack by opening his chest, emitting a shining white light. Every player must unload as much firepower as possible into Oryx's chest, aiming for the dead center of the glowing area to be sure to hit the vulnerable spot. With sufficient damage, Oryx will stagger. (With insufficient damage, the fireteam will wipe.)\n\nNow, the Corrupted Light spheres dropped by the Ogres may be used. Four players must each run to one sphere and stand near it for about five seconds, until a message acknowledging this appears, and then run back into the aura carried by the torn player to be protected from the Corrupted Light detonation. During this time, at least one other player needs to continue to damage Oryx. As long as Oryx is taking sustained damage while the Corrupted Lights are detonated, the detonation will do a significant amount of damage to Oryx. Any remaining normal enemies will be killed and Oryx will shudder and fall off the side of the area.\n\nOryx will rise at the end of the arena and begin firing on every player at once, as indicated by white circles that appear at their positions and then explode. This may be countered by sprinting around the arena. After a short time, the barrage will cease.\n\nWhen Oryx is below 50% health, he will no longer do the barrage attack after the Corrupted Lights are detonated and will instead create a bubble of darkness at one end of the arena, and one by one every member of the fireteam will be teleported into it. Within the bubble is a small arena with a foggy perimeter and a Shade of Oryx. Guardian health does not recharge while inside the bubble. Guardians not yet teleported into the bubble may assist those that are, by killing the other enemies in the arena, who will try to enter the bubble. If the echo is defeated within one minute, the arena will dissolve and return the players to the main encounter.\n\nWhen Oryx reaches less than 1% health, he will appear at the far end of the arena and open his chest. The fireteam must deal a small amount of damage to his chest in order to kill him and complete the encounter.",

From these primordial origins the Vex began to spread. The Vex appeared on Venus from an unknown location by way of transfer gates that allow them to instantly warp through worlds and time. All attempts to communicate with the Vex have failed, due to their single purpose to expand their species throughout the galaxy, commanded by Axis Minds that single-handedly control whole armies.\n\nTheir bodies are made of an unknown metal alloy resembling hammered brass, yet they are not entirely mechanical; some organic materials are present as well. If they are decapitated, they will remain active and become more aggressive. Their routines and ceremonies remain mysterious and illogical to humans; they are hostile, unrelenting, and deadly.

Decrepit and rickety cars, some of which contain the remains of refugees who were attempting to escape the planet, are a frequent sight.\n\nThe inside of the Cosmodrome is overrun by the Fallen House of Devils. The dry terrain and dimly lit interiors of old buildings are a magnet for invading Fallen soldiers. The Hive also occupy some regions within Old Kazakhstan.",
