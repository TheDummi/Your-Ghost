The Fallen have four eyes that glow a bright white-blue when they are alive, but once killed, the light dies out. In their mouths are two rows of sharp, knife-like teeth, indicating that the Fallen are carnivorous in nature. This is also implied from Saint-14 when he said he saw Dregs eating children. The Fallen are also capable of growing back their arms, as Dregs are allowed to develop their other two arms upon being granted the honor of becoming a Vandal.\n\nFallen cannot survive without Ether, which is distributed to them by their Servitors.

Their underground spaces are like a dungeon that has only recently been pulled up from too long underwater. They have existed for billions of years in service to the Worm Gods who gave them their abilities directly from the Formless One. In return for their service, the Worm Gods helped them escape the incoming Syzygy that was going to destroy their homeworld of Fundament. They follow a religion called the Sword Logic, which is an extreme form of Darwinism where only the strongest survive.\n\nThe Hive intend to evoke a feeling of \"undead royalty,\" and are a vaguely humanoid species with \"dry, flaking skin encrusted with ancient armor.\" At least some of the Hive appear to have supernatural abilities, including the ability to hover or float and manipulate energy and electricity.[6][7]",

    "biology": "The Vex originated from before the beginning of the universe as highly tenacious patterns fleeing destruction at the battle fought outside of cause and effect. In the earliest epochs of the universe, the Vex existed as patterns in the primordial chaos, and later during the era of atomic matter rode comets down to young worlds and encoded themselves as a substrate of Radiolaria. From these primordial origins the Vex began to spread. The Vex appeared on Venus from an unknown location by way of transfer gates that allow them to instantly warp through worlds and time. All attempts to communicate with the Vex have failed, due to their single purpose to expand their species throughout the galaxy, commanded by Axis Minds that single-handedly control whole armies.\n\nTheir bodies are made of an unknown metal alloy resembling hammered brass, yet they are not entirely mechanical; some organic materials are present as well. If they are decapitated, they will remain active and become more aggressive. Their routines and ceremonies remain mysterious and illogical to humans; they are hostile, unrelenting, and deadly. The Vex despise the Cabal as much as humanity and are constantly fighting them on Mars, keeping Cabal operations from expanding further into the system.\n\nBungie has described the Vex as having a \"fascinating\" fiction behind them, \"which, in turn, creates one of the coolest deaths in the game.\"",

    "tactic": "In regular combat, Psions present a threat equal to or less than that of standard Legionaries. Their thinner armor means they take more damage than a full-fledged Cabal unit, even on higher difficulties, and they can easily be dispatched with a few center of mass shots or a well-placed headshot. They only become a threat if the Epic modifier is active, which grants them a Void shield.\n\nAlthough they are physically weak, Psions are no pushovers. When they begin to glow and float slightly, they will release a shockwave attack. This move is extremely powerful, reducing even the best Guardians to critical health by simply being near the blast. It has a medium range, and can go through solid cover, meaning the only true way to avoid this attack is to either back up several paces, or run a good distance to the side. Therefore, it's advised that when they begin to signal this attack, either use this opportunity to dispatch them quickly, or move out of the vicinity.",
